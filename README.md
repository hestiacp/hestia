Installing development builds
=============================
To install a development build based on the latest published code, you must first have an existing installation of Hestia available. If you do not have a server configured, please install the latest stable build using the instructions above before continuing.

**Development builds should not be installed on systems with live production data.**

## Step 1: Download the compiler script
